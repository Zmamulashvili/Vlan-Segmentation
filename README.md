# Vlan-Segmentation
Cisco Packet Tracer lab demonstrating VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing using router-on-a-stick.
# Office VLAN Lab

## Project Description
This lab simulates an office network with multiple VLANs and inter-VLAN routing. It is designed for practicing VLAN creation, port assignment, trunk configuration, and router subinterfaces.

## Network Topology
- Devices: 1 Router, 1 Switch, 24 PCs
- VLANs: 5 VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
- VLAN to PC distribution:
  - VLAN 10 (Department 1)   – 5 PCs
  - VLAN 20 (Department 2)   – 5 PCs
  - VLAN 30 (Department 3)   – 4 PCs
  - VLAN 40 (Department 4)   – 5 PCs
  - VLAN 50 (Department 5)   – 5 PCs

## IP Addressing
| VLAN | Subnet           | Default Gateway | Hosts |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| 10   | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.10.1   | 5     |
| 20   | 192.168.20.0/24 | 192.168.20.1   | 5     |
| 30   | 192.168.30.0/24 | 192.168.30.1   | 4     |
| 40   | 192.168.40.0/24 | 192.168.40.1   | 5     |
| 50   | 192.168.50.0/24 | 192.168.50.1   | 5     |

## Lab Setup Instructions
1. Open the Packet Tracer file: `Office_VLAN_Lab.pkt`
2. Verify VLANs and port assignments on the switch:
   - `show vlan brief`
3. Verify trunk configuration between switch and router.
4. Verify router subinterfaces for inter-VLAN routing.
5. Test connectivity:
   - Ping the router gateway from PCs in each VLAN.
   - Ping PCs across VLANs to ensure routing works.

## Screenshots
- See `Diagrams/Logical_View.png` for the network layout.

## Notes
- All PCs are assigned static IP addresses.
- DHCP is not configured in this lab.
